Aquarium Roadmap
================

Note Before
------------

- Assuming about 2 person time per team, backend and frontend, to tolerate
  non-exclusive work in Aquarium (e.g., support incidents).
- Attempt to add different work streams, albeit somewhat related, in the 
  backend when work packages seem to be a one-person thing.
- None of this should discourage people from working on other things should
  they have time, get blocked, or `enter reason here`.
- All work packages are being set with Joao rough-estimating effort they
  **might** take.
- All of this meant for discussion, and subject to change.


Milestones
----------

M4
~~~

* Frontend improvement

  * Dashboard

    * Adding new widgets (TBD)

      * Change existing widgets

        * Rename "Capacity" to "Allocated"
        * Health message displayed on hover?
    * Backend support for what is required

  * Install Wizard

    * Devices config step (mostly backend, I hope)

* Testing improvements

  * All PRs need unit tests
  * Functional tests to stress the API (against a running cluster)
