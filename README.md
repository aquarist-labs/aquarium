Project Aquarium is a SUSE-sponsored open source project aiming at becoming an easy to use, rock solid storage appliance based on Ceph.

We are investigating the beginnings of a new storage appliance project in an opinionated fashion. The Aquarium project is split into two clearly defined work streams: Gravel (backend) and Glass (frontend).

Aquarist Labs is licensed under GPL version 3, except where other licenses may apply. We do not require assignment of a copyright to contribute code; code is contributed under the terms of the applicable license.

## How do I get started?

Look at the [issue](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues) list or
check out our Slack channel (see below) and ask one of the friendly contributors.
You can also view our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/aquarist-labs/projects/3)
and check our [Review Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to get your hands dirty as soon as possible, you can also run the
script at `tools/setup-dev.sh`. This will ensure you have a basic development
environment as soon as possible so you can start hacking.

You will be able to find the backend bits in `src/gravel`, while the frontend
bits are located in `src/glass`.
