Project Aquarium is a SUSE-sponsored open source project aiming at becoming an easy to use, rock solid storage appliance based on Ceph.

We are investigating the beginnings of a new storage appliance project in an opinionated fashion. The Aquariums project is split into two clearly defined work streams: Gravel (backend) and Glass (frontend).

## How do I get started?

Look at the [issue](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues) list, or
contact the [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/aquarist-labs/people) and
see what's up.

If you want to get your hands dirty as soon as possible, you can also run the
script at `tools/setup-dev.sh`. This will ensure you have a basic development
environment as soon as possible so you can start hacking.

You will be able to find the backend bits in `src/gravel`, while the frontend
bits are located in `src/glass`.

Check out our [From Zero to Hacking](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/blob/main/doc/from-zero-to-hacking.md)
