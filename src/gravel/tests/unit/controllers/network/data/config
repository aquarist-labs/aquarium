# Note: 
# Most of the options can and should be overridden by per-interface
# settings in the ifcfg-* files.

# Note: The ISC dhclient started by the NetworkManager is not using any
# of these options -- NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.

# List of DNS nameserver IP addresses to use for host-name lookup.
# When the NETCONFIG_DNS_FORWARDER variable is set to "resolver",
# the name servers are written directly to /etc/resolv.conf.
# Otherwise, the nameserver are written into a forwarder specific
# configuration file and the /etc/resolv.conf does not contain any
# nameservers causing the glibc to use the name server on the local
# machine (the forwarder). See also netconfig(8) manual page.
