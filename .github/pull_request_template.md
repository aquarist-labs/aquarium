<!--
Thank you for opening a pull request!  Here are some tips on creating
a well formatted contribution.

Please give your pull request a title like "[component]: [short description]"

This is the format for commit messages:

"""
[component]: [short description]

[A longer multiline description]

Fixes: [issue id or URL on https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues, create one if necessary]
Signed-off-by: [Your Name] <[your email]>
"""

The component is the short name of a major module or subsystem, something 
like "tools", "gravel", "glass", "doc", etc.

For more examples, simply use "git log" and look at some historical commits.

This was just a quick overview.  More information for contributors is available here:
